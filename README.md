## Project 2
## Chapman University, Fall 2024
## By Tade Scheid

This project was intended to create a visual based off of the same data I used in my first project. The data I am using is WNBA stats from 2019. The data compares players from 23 different WNBA teams in categories such as age, position, win statistics, free throw rate, and other individual basketball statistics.

## Visual Created

The visual I created plots the free throw rates of players by age of the players. It plots lines based off of the positions of Center, Center-Forward, Forward, Forward-Center, Forward-Guard, Guard, and Guard-Forward. In total there are seven lines color coded for each position which is specified in the legend. 

## Organization 
This project was made as a RProject. It is in standard organization with all files located in the Project-2 folder. The raw WNBA data file, Project 2 Rmd, Project 2 RProj, this README.md, and the final Project-2 html file are under this folder. I created a single repository on Github that has these elements as well. 

## Installation
To run make sure to have R and RStudio installed. Open github repository. Download raw files and open in Rstudio. Add packages ggplot2, janitor, and ggrepel in RStudio. Run all chunks to get visual.
